Blogs have become an integral part of online culture.<br><br>
Practically everyone reads blogs now, whether they&#39;re &#34;official&#34; news blogs associated with traditional news media, topic-based blogs related to one&#39;s work or hobbies, or blogs purely for entertainment, just about anyone you ask has at least one favorite blog.<br>
But it wasn&#39;t always so. Blogs have a relatively short history, even when compared with the history of the Internet itself.<br>
And it&#39;s only in the past five to ten years that they&#39;re really taken off and become an important part of the online landscape.
