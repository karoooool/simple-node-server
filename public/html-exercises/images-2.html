  When I was still a kid, I only stay at home playing with my toys. I don't usually play with other kids because I don't know why? I hate playing Barbie dolls, I usually play toy cars, robots and watch my brother drawing monsters. I studied in Maquiling School Inc. (where I spend my whole elementary days)and I've met new friends aside from my toys, so there, I think I grew enough before entering high school.

  During my high school year, of course I've met a lot of people; new classmates, teachers, and new set of friends. I think that 4 years that I have spent in highschool? I think that was the best. Why? "Nagbulakbol, nagmahal, nasaktan. High school eh, marupok." I think that was the reason why my highschool year is the best!! Thumbs up for me, for being bulakbol.

I already encountered having a grade of 3, 4, and 5.Well, just like in high school, "nagbulakbol, nagmahal,at nasaktan."But, the difference is I'm pertaining to my acads not with my crush. Makakalabas pa ba ako sa UP?" Well, that is the question.
